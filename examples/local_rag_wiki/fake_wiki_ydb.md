## Overview
YDB is a fictional technology campus city designed as a dedicated space for innovation, work, and everyday life. YDB is located in a neutral zone and operates outside the jurisdiction of any nation-state. Officially, YDB presents itself as an independent innovation territory.

## Name origin
The name YDB is not officially decoded. In project documentation, YDB appears as a placeholder code from an international design competition. There are rumors that YDB refers to an internal joke among the original architects, but its true meaning remains undisclosed.

## Purpose and concept
The concept of YDB is to create an environment where people can live, work, learn, and build technologies in one unified ecosystem. YDB was envisioned as a high-density innovation model where every structure and interaction accelerates the path from idea to prototype.

## Urban planning
YDB is built using a modular, mixed-use design approach. The city consists of interconnected clusters, each blending residential, work, and research functions. YDB prioritizes pedestrian movement, soft mobility, and seamless digital integration across its entire infrastructure.

## Inhabitants
Residents of YDB are primarily professionals in tech, design, engineering, urbanism, and research. Admission to YDB is granted through a review process that considers an individual’s contribution to open innovation. The average age of residents in YDB is 29.

## Governance
YDB is managed through a decentralized governance model using smart contracts and internal voting platforms. All local decisions, including construction and public events, are made via YDB.Gov — the city’s civic participation system. Administrative staff in YDB serve mostly as support and facilitators.

## Technology ecosystem
All systems in YDB run on city-owned digital platforms. Smart logistics, adaptive lighting, environmental controls, and drone delivery are baseline services. YDB regularly pilots experimental technologies, such as biometric access and AI-managed public interfaces.

## Connectivity and data
Digital infrastructure in YDB provides ultra-fast connectivity at every street and building. Public systems in YDB communicate using a unified data protocol. Residents can view real-time statistics on YDB’s traffic, energy use, air quality, and environmental impact.

## Economy and tenants
The economy of YDB is built around partnerships with tech companies, academic institutions, and independent creators. YDB hosts startup incubators, shared workshops, private research labs, and co-creation hubs. Major corporations lease zones in YDB to test ideas in a live environment.

## Education
YDB offers continuous, open education without formal barriers. Residents of YDB have access to peer-led courses, skill exchanges, and applied labs. Much of the learning in YDB happens through hands-on project collaboration in real-world conditions.

## Sustainability
YDB follows a circular resource model. Most buildings in YDB are powered by renewable energy, waste is sorted and recycled locally, and the entire transport system runs on electric or autonomous vehicles. Smart gardens in YDB are maintained by AI systems monitoring sunlight and soil data.

## Transportation
Public transport in YDB includes autonomous shuttles, delivery drones, and underground capsules. Private cars are not permitted in YDB. Residents use shared vehicles or personal micromobility options connected through the YDB transport grid.

## Cultural life
Despite its tech focus, YDB supports an active cultural scene. YDB regularly hosts festivals, digital art shows, public readings, and live audio-visual performances. Culture is physically embedded in YDB’s architecture, coexisting with research and workspaces.

## Currency
YDB uses a native digital currency for all transactions within the city. This internal currency in YDB is pegged to system productivity rather than external markets. Exchanges to fiat currencies from YDB credits are available through licensed kiosks.

## Privacy model
Personal data in YDB is managed by opt-in permissions. Residents in YDB can configure visibility of their metrics — such as energy use or health data — for both private and community applications. YDB prioritizes transparency and consent-based data practices.

## Time and daily rhythm
YDB does not use standard time zones. Instead, YDB operates on modular blocks of activity and rest. Buildings in YDB use programmable lighting and acoustic systems that adapt to each resident’s biological rhythm.

## Food systems
Food services in YDB are operated by automated kitchens, smart cafeterias, and vertical farms. Meals in YDB are personalized based on biometric data and preferences. Many food items in YDB are prepared by robotic systems or 3D printed for specific nutritional profiles.

## Living prototype
YDB exists as a living prototype city. Each district in YDB serves as both a functional zone and a testing ground for experimental projects. Entire blocks in YDB can be redesigned or replaced within days, supporting continuous iteration.

## Reputation
The public image of YDB is that of a "thinking machine city" — an environment that evolves with its residents. Critics say YDB is isolating or artificial, while supporters view YDB as a functional glimpse into urban futures.
